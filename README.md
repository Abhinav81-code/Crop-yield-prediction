🌾 Crop Yield Prediction System
This project is a complete data-driven solution designed to predict crop yield using machine learning. It includes an interactive Streamlit web application, a detailed Power BI dashboard, and a reproducible model-building pipeline.

📁 Project Components
Jupyter Notebook (Project_Crop_yield.ipynb): Covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training.

Streamlit App (appp.py): Allows users to input various agricultural parameters and receive crop yield predictions.

Power BI Dashboard (power bi crop ORGINAL.pbix): Offers rich visual insights into regional yields, crop performance, weather impact, and farming practices.

Model Files: Includes the trained ML model (model.pkl), a scaler (scaler.pkl), and label encoders (label_encoder.pkl) for prediction.

🚀 Key Features
Predicts crop yield (in MT/HA) based on real-world agricultural data.

User-friendly web interface with customizable input options.

Interactive Power BI dashboard for visual storytelling.

Modular and scalable pipeline for machine learning.

🔍 Machine Learning Overview
The model is trained to predict Crop_Yield_MT_per_HA using a mix of categorical, numerical, and boolean features.

Categorical data is label-encoded, and numerical data is scaled for better model performance.

Predictions are made based on features such as region, soil type, crop, rainfall, temperature, fertilizer and irrigation usage, weather condition, and days to harvest.

📊 Power BI Insights
The dashboard includes:

Crop-wise and region-wise yield trends

Analysis of fertilizer and irrigation use

Impact of temperature and rainfall on yield

Summarized KPIs for quick understanding

🌱 Use Case
Ideal for:

Farmers and agronomists to make data-backed decisions

Agricultural researchers studying yield patterns

Policymakers exploring food production trends
