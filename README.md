# Predicting Crop Yield Using AI & Business Intelligence
This project presents a comprehensive solution for predicting crop yield using Machine Learning and Business Intelligence tools. It combines predictive modeling through a user-friendly Streamlit app with an interactive Power BI dashboard to support agricultural decision-making, policy formulation, and resource planning.

# Project Overview
With rising concerns over food security and climate change, accurate crop yield prediction has become essential. This project addresses that need by analyzing agricultural data and building a machine learning model to estimate crop yield (in MT/HA) based on environmental and farming conditions. An integrated Power BI dashboard offers visual insights for stakeholders to understand regional performance and influencing factors.

# Key Features
Predictive model for estimating crop yield based on real-time inputs

In-depth data analysis on soil type, weather, fertilizer usage, and irrigation

Streamlit app for interactive predictions and exploration

Power BI dashboard with visual storytelling and KPIs

AI-driven insights for yield optimization and planning

# Methodology
Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables

Scaled numerical features and engineered useful features (e.g., temperature category)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed rainfall, temperature, days to harvest, and crop patterns

Visualized correlations and trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn

Model Building

Trained a regression model to predict Crop_Yield_MT_per_HA

Used label encoding for categorical fields and applied scaling

Evaluated model performance using R² and error metrics

Streamlit Application

Developed a user interface for farmers or analysts to input data

Live prediction of crop yield based on environmental and farm inputs

# Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard titled "Crop Yield Analysis & Forecasting" provides:

Total and average yield across regions and crops

Visual correlation of rainfall, temperature, and yield

Breakdown of yield based on irrigation and fertilizer use

Dynamic filters to compare soil types, weather conditions, and crops

Geographic view of productivity zones

# Key Statistics:

Highest Yielding Region: Central Plains

Average Rainfall Across Crops: 522 mm

Average Temperature: 28.3°C

Most Commonly Used Fertilizer: NPK

# Tools & Technologies
Python for data preprocessing and machine learning

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Streamlit for building the interactive web app

Power BI Desktop for dynamic dashboard creation

#  Project Outcomes
This project demonstrates how AI and BI tools can be combined to predict agricultural outputs effectively. It empowers decision-makers with predictive insights, enhances resource planning, and improves agricultural productivity through data-driven strategies.
